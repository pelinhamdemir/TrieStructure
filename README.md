Trie Data Structure Implementation


This project necessitates the implementation of a Trie data structure capable of supporting various operations such as searching, counting prefixes, finding words with a given suffix, determining the shortest unique prefix, and identifying the longest common prefix.

Code Design
The code design follows a modular approach, distinguishing between two main classes: Main and TrieST.

Main Class
The Main class facilitates user interaction. It provides functionalities to interact with the Trie data structure, such as inserting words, searching for words, counting prefixes, finding words with a given suffix, determining the shortest unique prefix, and identifying the longest common prefix. It handles input/output operations and serves as the entry point for the program.

TrieST Class
The TrieST class encapsulates Trie operations. It implements the Trie data structure and provides methods to perform various operations efficiently. These operations include inserting a word into the Trie, searching for a word, counting prefixes, finding words with a given suffix, determining the shortest unique prefix, and identifying the longest common prefix. The TrieST class ensures the integrity and consistency of the Trie data structure and abstracts the implementation details from the user.

Usage
To use the Trie data structure implementation, follow these steps:

Instantiate the Main class.
Use the provided methods to interact with the Trie data structure:
Insert words using the insert method.
Search for words using the search method.
Count prefixes using the countPrefixes method.
Find words with a given suffix using the findWithSuffix method.
Determine the shortest unique prefix using the shortestUniquePrefix method.
Identify the longest common prefix using the longestCommonPrefix method.
Follow the prompts and input/output instructions provided by the Main class to perform desired operations.
